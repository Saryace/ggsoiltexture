\title{Plot Soil Texture Data Using a Ternary Plot}
\usage{
ggsoiltexture(data, show_grid = TRUE, class = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing soil texture data. It must include columns `clay`, `silt`, and `sand`,
which represent the percentages of clay, silt, and sand, respectively. The sum of these three
columns must be approximately 100% (within 0.1% tolerance).}

\item{show_grid}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), a grid is displayed on the plot to aid interpretation.}

\item{class}{A character string specifying the soil texture classification system to overlay on the plot.
Supported values are `"USDA"`, `"NZ"`, `"NZG"`, `"GERMAN"`, `"SSEW"` and `"SWISS"`. If `NULL` (default),
no classification polygons are displayed.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object representing the soil texture ternary plot.
}
\description{
This function creates a ternary plot for soil texture data, showing the proportions of sand, silt, and clay.
It allows for customization of the grid display and the addition of soil texture classification polygons.
}
\examples{
# Example data
soil_data <- data.frame(
  clay = c(20, 30, 40),
  silt = c(30, 40, 20),
  sand = c(50, 30, 40)
)

# Basic plot
ggsoiltexture(soil_data)

# Plot with USDA classification
ggsoiltexture(soil_data, class = "USDA")

# Plot without grid
ggsoiltexture(soil_data, show_grid = FALSE)

}
